# AI4D-News-Classification-Challenge
The objective for this challenge was to develop a multi-class classification model to classify news content according to six specific categories.  
The model can be used by Swahili online platforms to automatically group news according to their categories and help readers find the specific news they want to read. In addition, the model will contribute to a body of work ensuring that Swahili is represented in apps and other online products in future.

I managed to achieve a log loss of 0.365904082280382 and emerged at position 10 from 52 participants .
